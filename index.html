    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, welcome to my personal website. I am currently a PhD student in Linguistics at McGill University. I do most of my research in the area of theoretical phonology, with occasional forays into theoretical syntax. I am mostly interested in prosodic structures and how they are mapped from the syntactic module. You can find the materials related to my research under the Research tab.</p>

      <h3>Phonology of Garo</h3>
      <p>Most of my graduate school research (MA at Calgary, ongoing PhD at McGill) has focused on the phonology of Garo. There are however, some issues in other languages (Banawa and Popti') that I spend time on, but unfortunately, I have not been able to invest enough time on the analysis.</p>
